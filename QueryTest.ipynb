To test the possibility that some lifeforms similar\\nto the terrestrial ones may survive on Mars, we designed and built two\\nsimulators of Martian environments where to perform experiments with different\\nbacterial strains: LISA and mini-LISA. Our LISA environmental chambers can\\nreproduce the conditions of many Martian locations near the surface trough\\nchanges of temperature, pressure, UV fluence and atmospheric composition. Both\\nsimulators are open to collaboration with other laboratories interested in\\nperforming experiments on many kind of samples (biological, minerals,\\nelectronic) in situations similar to that of the red planet. Inside LISA we\\nhave studied the survival of several bacterial strains and endospores. We\\nverified that the UV light is the major responsible of cell death. Neither the\\nlow temperature, nor the pressure, nor the desiccation or the atmospheric\\nchanges were effective in this sense. We found that some Bacillus strains have\\na particular capability to survive for some hours in Martian conditions without\\nbeing screened by dust or other shields. We also simulated the coverage\\nhappening on a planet by dust transported by the winds, blowing on the samples\\na very small quantity of volcanic ash grains or red iron oxide particles.\\nSamples covered by these dust grains have shown a high percentage of survival,\\nindicating that under the surface dust, if life were to be present on Mars in\\nthe past, some bacteria colonies or cells could still be present.\\n', 'keywords': 'lisa\\nmartian\\nuv\\ndust\\nsamples\\nluca\\nsimilar\\nbacterial strains\\nlocations\\ntemperature pressure\\natmospheric\\nash\\nminerals', 'doi': '1002.4077v2', 'citations': 1, 'label': 0, 'n_citations': 0.005382131324004305, 'n_published': 0.6572327044025172, 'silhouette_score': 0.723662213844651, 'text_label': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.5031847133757962}\n",

In Monte Carlo\\nexperiments, we analyze large samples of astrometric data sets with low to\\nmoderate signal-to-noise ratios. We treat the idealized case of a single planet\\norbiting a single star, and assume there are no non-Keplerian complications or\\nuncertainties. The real case can only be more difficult. We use periodograms\\nfor discovery and least-squares fits for estimating the Keplerian parameters.\\nWe find a completeness for detection compatible with estimates in the\\nliterature. We find mass estimation by least squares to be biased, as has been\\nfound for noisy radial-velocity data sets; this bias degrades the completeness\\nof accurate mass estimation. When we compare the true planetary position with\\nthe position predicted from the fitted orbital parameters, at future times, we\\nfind low completeness for an accuracy goal of 0.3 times the semimajor axis of\\nthe planet, even with no delay following the end of astrometric observations.\\nOur findings suggest that the recommendation of the ExoPlanet Task Force\\n(Lunine et al. 2008) for \"the capability to measure convincingly wobble\\nsemi-amplitudes down to 0.2 $\\\\mu$as integrated over the mission lifetime,\" may\\nnot be satisfied by an instrument characterized by the noise floor of the Space\\nInterferometry Mission, $\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{floor}\\\\approx0.035\\\\mu$as.
